It is my old core for tile game, not implemented fully. I started learn Java at those time. 
Basicly the tile core is based on two dimensional arrays(layers) which represents objects 
and player placement inside the game space, as well as obstacles, sounds and vision layers.

Game has classes for graphical interface and for object animation
